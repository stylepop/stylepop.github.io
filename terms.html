      <p>
        By using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
        therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or
        modify our trademarks in any way. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
        database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to

        StylePop is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For
        that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services,
        at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without
        making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

        The StylePop app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order

        With respect to StylePop’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the
        app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated
        and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
        we can make it available to you. StylePop accepts no liability for any loss, direct or
        indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
